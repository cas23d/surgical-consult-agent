    "context": "## CURRENT MANAGEMENT\nBased on the chart, I see minimal management initiated:\n- **Imaging completed**: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast showing perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with abscess\n- **Basic vitals monitoring**: Patient in ED Room 12 with vitals obtained\n\n**Critical gaps**: No evidence of resuscitation efforts, antibiotics, or supportive care measures documented despite patient showing signs of sepsis.\n\n## GAPS IN CURRENT MANAGEMENT\nSeveral urgent interventions are missing for this septic patient with perforated diverticulitis:\n\n- **IV fluid resuscitation**: Patient is hypotensive (94/58) with elevated lactate (4.8) and tachycardic \u2014 needs immediate fluid boluses\n- **Broad-spectrum antibiotics**: WBC 18.9, fever 38.3\u00b0C, perforation with abscess \u2014 should have piperacillin-tazobactam or similar coverage started emergently\n- **Blood cultures**: Should be drawn before antibiotics given sepsis picture\n- **Type & Screen/Crossmatch**: Surgical intervention likely needed \u2014 blood products should be available\n- **NG tube decompression**: Likely bowel rest needed with perforation\n- **Foley catheter**: For accurate I/O monitoring given hypotension and elevated creatinine\n- **Arterial blood gas**: Lactate 4.8 and tachypnea suggest possible metabolic acidosis\n\n## MISSING INFORMATION\n\n**Prior abdominal surgeries** \u2014 Changes surgical approach entirely; adhesions affect operative planning and may necessitate open vs. laparoscopic approach\n\n**Anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications** \u2014 Not listed in home meds but critical for perioperative bleeding risk assessment\n\n**Code status and advance directives** \u2014 68-year-old with serious condition requiring urgent surgical decision-making\n\n**Last oral intake** \u2014 Essential for anesthesia timing and aspiration risk\n\n**Baseline functional status and living situation** \u2014 Affects surgical risk stratification and discharge planning for elderly patient\n\n**Prior episodes of diverticulitis** \u2014 History of conservative management vs. recurrent disease influences surgical urgency\n\n**Current symptoms onset and progression** \u2014 Duration helps differentiate acute vs. chronic perforation and guides urgency of intervention\n\n**Family availability for consent** \u2014 May need emergent surgery and patient appears acutely ill\n\n**Baseline creatinine** \u2014 Current creatinine 1.6 with BUN 28 \u2014 need to know if this represents acute kidney injury from sepsis",
    "plan": "## ASSESSMENT\n\nI was consulted on Harold Whitaker, a 68-year-old male presenting with acute abdominal pain and CT findings of pneumoperitoneum. He is hemodynamically unstable with hypotension (94/58), tachycardia (112 bpm), fever (38.3\u00b0C), leukocytosis (18.9), and elevated lactate (4.8). Physical examination reveals a rigid abdomen with peritonitis. CT demonstrates moderate pneumoperitoneum, sigmoid wall thickening with surrounding inflammation, and a 2.5 cm pericolic abscess - findings consistent with perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with Hinchey III disease. This is a surgical emergency requiring urgent operative intervention.\n\n## RECOMMENDED PLAN\n\n- Start aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with crystalloids, vasopressor support as needed, and broad-spectrum antibiotics — piperacillin-tazobactam or carbapenem plus metronidazole — within the hour (WSES 2016, Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021)\n- NPO, place Foley catheter for I/O monitoring, NG tube for decompression\n- Recommend urgent exploratory laparotomy with resection of the perforated segment — given his hemodynamic instability and peritonitis, this will likely be a Hartmann procedure rather than primary anastomosis (ASCRS 2014)\n- Notify anesthesia — high-risk case with active sepsis, will need ICU-level monitoring perioperatively\n- Book urgent OR, type and crossmatch for 4 units PRBC, ensure ostomy supplies available\n\n## GUIDELINE CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- **ASCRS 2014 Practice Parameters for Sigmoid Diverticulitis**: Hinchey III/IV disease with generalized peritonitis requires urgent surgical intervention. This patient meets criteria with free air, abscess, and peritonitis.\n- **WSES 2016 Jerusalem Guidelines for Acute Diverticulitis**: Recommend emergent surgery for perforated diverticulitis with diffuse peritonitis and sepsis. Hartmann procedure favored over primary anastomosis in hemodynamically unstable patients.\n- **Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021**: Early aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour for septic shock (lactate >4, hypotension).\n\nStandard guidelines apply cleanly to this patient. No prior abdominal surgeries per patient history, so no altered anatomy concerns. Age 68 is not prohibitive for surgery, and patient is a full code requesting all interventions.\n\n## SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL WORKUP\n\n**Immediate labs:**\n- Type and crossmatch for 4 units PRBC\n- PT/PTT/INR for operative planning\n- Arterial blood gas to assess acid-base status and lactate trend\n- Repeat basic metabolic panel to monitor renal function (creatinine already elevated at 1.6)\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- ECG given tachycardia and hemodynamic instability\n- Chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia or other pulmonary pathology\n- Consider echocardiogram if concerned about cardiac cause of hypotension, though clinical picture most consistent with septic shock\n\n**Consults:**\n- Anesthesia for high-risk operative case\n- ICU consultation for postoperative management given sepsis and hemodynamic instability\n- Consider infectious disease consultation for antibiotic optimization, particularly if patient fails to improve postoperatively",

His vitals are concerning - he's hypotensive at 94/58, tachycardic at 112, febrile to 38.3, with a lactate of 4.8 and white count of 18.9. When I examined him, he has a rigid abdomen with clear peritoneal signs. My concern is that he has perforated diverticulitis with sepsis and needs urgent operative intervention - I'm recommending we take him for exploratory laparotomy with likely sigmoid resection and possible diversion given the degree of contamination and his hemodynamic instability.\n\n---\n\n## FOLLOW-UP TASKS\n\n**IMMEDIATE (next 30 minutes):**\n- [ ] Call attending surgeon for urgent evaluation\n- [ ] Obtain consent for exploratory laparotomy \u00b1 sigmoid resection \u00b1 diversion\n- [ ] Alert OR for urgent case\n- [ ] Start broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (pip-tazo or cipro/flagyl)\n- [ ] Place foley catheter\n- [ ] Obtain type and screen, consider crossmatch for 2 units PRBC\n\n**SHORT-TERM (next 2-4 hours):**\n- [ ] Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation, reassess hemodynamics\n- [ ] Consider vasopressor support if hypotension persists despite fluids\n- [ ] Repeat lactate in 2 hours to assess response\n- [ ] Pre-operative labs if not already sent (PT/PTT, basic metabolic panel)\n\n**DOCUMENTATION/LOGISTICS:**\n- [ ] Complete formal H&P once patient to OR\n- [ ] Notify family of diagnosis and planned surgery\n- [ ] Ensure ICU bed availability for post-operative care"
