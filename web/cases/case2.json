Radiologist suggests possible ischemic changes in sigmoid.\n\n**Critical limitation**: No IV contrast severely limits assessment of bowel perfusion. Given this patient's afib history and clinical presentation of septic shock, mesenteric ischemia remains high on differential but cannot be adequately evaluated on this study.\n\n**Bottom line**: This patient is in septic shock and needs immediate resuscitation and likely surgical evaluation for possible ischemic bowel.",

    "plan": "## ASSESSMENT\n\nI was consulted on Eugene Morales, a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation on apixaban, CAD, CKD stage 3, and prior AAA repair who presents with acute onset abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and altered mental status. He is hemodynamically unstable with hypotension (SBP 88-94), tachycardia (HR 118-122), fever (38.3-38.5\u00b0C), and signs of sepsis with elevated lactate (4.6), leukocytosis (18.4), and metabolic acidosis (pH 7.29, HCO3 15). CT shows diffuse colitis with pericolonic stranding and questionable pneumatosis in the sigmoid colon. My examination reveals diffuse abdominal tenderness worst in the LLQ with mild guarding, gross blood on rectal exam, but no rebound tenderness. The patient is confused but has palpable femoral pulses and warm feet without mottling.\n\nThe surgical question is whether this represents ischemic colitis requiring urgent intervention versus infectious/inflammatory colitis that can be managed medically. Given his hemodynamic instability, elevated lactate, and CT findings suggestive of possible ischemic changes, he requires urgent evaluation for surgical intervention.\n\n## RECOMMENDED PLAN\n\n1. **Immediate resuscitation with IV fluids and vasopressors if needed**\n   - Supporting evidence: Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines 2021 recommend early aggressive fluid resuscitation for septic shock\n   - Note: His CKD stage 3 and elevated creatinine (2.4) require careful fluid balance monitoring\n\n2. **Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone/metronidazole)**\n   - Supporting evidence: IDSA 2017 Guidelines for Clostridium difficile recommend empiric treatment for severe colitis\n   - Guideline applies as current regimen covers both infectious and translocation-related sepsis\n\n3. **Urgent CT angiography of abdomen/pelvis**\n   - Supporting evidence: ACR Appropriateness Criteria 2020 for Acute Colitis recommend CTA when ischemic etiology suspected\n   - Critical given elevated lactate, hemodynamic instability, and prior vascular disease history\n\n4. **Reverse anticoagulation given active GI bleeding**\n   - Supporting evidence: AHA/ACC 2019 Guidelines recommend reversal for life-threatening bleeding\n   - Last apixaban dose this morning; consider 4-factor PCC given elevated INR (1.5) and active bleeding\n\n5. **Serial abdominal exams and lactate monitoring**\n   - Supporting evidence: ASCRS 2020 Practice Parameters emphasize clinical monitoring for deterioration\n   - Any worsening peritoneal signs or rising lactate should prompt immediate surgical exploration\n\n6. **NPO status and nasogastric decompression if distended**\n   - Supporting evidence: Standard surgical preparation for potential operative intervention\n   - Patient last ate 6pm yesterday, so appropriate NPO duration\n\n## GUIDELINE CONSIDERATIONS\n\nKey guidelines referenced:\n- **ASCRS 2020 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of Colonic Ischemia**: Recommend operative intervention for ischemic colitis with peritonitis, pneumatosis, or clinical deterioration despite medical management.\n- **ACR Appropriateness Criteria 2020 (Acute Nonlocalized Abdominal Pain)**: CTA recommended when ischemic etiology is suspected, particularly in patients with vascular disease history.\n- **AHA/ACC 2019 Focused Update on Anticoagulation Reversal**: Recommend reversal with 4-factor PCC for life-threatening bleeding in patients on direct oral anticoagulants.\n- **Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021**: Early aggressive fluid resuscitation and source control for septic shock.\n\nSeveral patient-specific factors complicate standard guideline application:\n\n- **Prior AAA repair with midline scar**: Significantly increases operative complexity for any potential colectomy. Altered anatomy from prior aortic surgery may affect collateral circulation to the colon (IMA ligation during AAA repair is a known risk factor for ischemic colitis per ASCRS 2020).\n\n- **Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation**: Creates tension between bleeding risk and thrombotic risk, particularly given his CAD and prior TIA. AHA/ACC 2019 guidelines favor reversal for life-threatening hemorrhage, but resumption timing is not well-defined for ischemic colitis patients.\n\n- **CKD stage 3**: Limits contrast exposure options (CTA requires IV contrast) and affects fluid management. Standard resuscitation volumes per Surviving Sepsis Campaign may need modification.\n\n- **Multiple cardiac comorbidities**: His CAD, atrial fibrillation, and age make him high-risk for emergency surgery. ACS NSQIP risk calculator should be referenced for operative risk stratification.\n\n## SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL WORKUP\n\n**Immediate Labs:**\n- Type and crossmatch for 4 units PRBC given active bleeding and hemodynamic instability\n- Repeat lactate in 2 hours to trend response to resuscitation\n- PT/PTT to fully assess coagulation status beyond INR\n\n**Imaging:**\n- CT angiography abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast (hold if creatinine worsens) to evaluate mesenteric circulation and rule out acute mesenteric ischemia\n\n**Consults:**\n- **Gastroenterology**: For potential urgent colonoscopy if hemodynamically stable and no perforation risk, per ACG 2020 Guidelines for Lower GI Bleeding\n- **Critical Care/Medicine**: For sepsis management and potential ICU-level care given hemodynamic instability\n- **Hematology**: For anticoagulation reversal guidance given complex bleeding/thrombotic risk profile\n\n**Monitoring:**\n- Continuous cardiac monitoring given atrial fibrillation and hemodynamic instability\n- Hourly urine output given CKD and fluid resuscitation\n- Serial abdominal exams every 2-4 hours for signs of perforation or worsening ischemia\n\nThe key decision point will be whether CTA shows adequate mesenteric perfusion or evidence of acute ischemia requiring emergent surgical intervention.",

His CT shows diffuse colitis with questionable ischemic changes in the sigmoid, and his lactate is 4.6 with leukocytosis to 18.4. On my exam, he's confused and hemodynamically unstable with diffuse abdominal tenderness worst in the LLQ, mild guarding, and gross blood on rectal exam - notably his feet are still warm with good pulses despite his shock. My concern is ischemic colitis in the setting of his afib and anticoagulation, and I'm recommending we get him to the ICU for resuscitation while we prepare for likely operative intervention given his clinical deterioration and concerning imaging findings.\n\n---\n\n## FOLLOW-UP TASKS\n\n**Immediate Actions:**\n- [ ] Staff case with attending surgeon immediately\n- [ ] ICU consultation for septic shock management\n- [ ] Type and crossmatch for 4 units PRBC\n- [ ] Obtain consent for potential emergency surgery\n- [ ] NPO status\n\n**Short-term Actions:**\n- [ ] Repeat lactate, CBC, BMP in 2-4 hours\n- [ ] Foley catheter for accurate I/O monitoring\n- [ ] Consider CT angiography if hemodynamically stable\n- [ ] Cardiology consultation given CAD/afib and perioperative risk\n- [ ] Hold anticoagulation - discuss reversal if urgent surgery needed\n\n**Documentation/Logistics:**\n- [ ] Complete full H&P documentation\n- [ ] Update family on condition and potential need for surgery\n- [ ] Coordinate with ICU for bed availability\n- [ ] Alert OR team of potential emergency case"
